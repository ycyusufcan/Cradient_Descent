# Gradient_Descent

What is Gradient Descent?
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined
by the negative of the gradient. In machine learning, we use gradient descent to update the parameters of our model. Parameters refer to coefficients
in Linear Regression and weights in neural networks.

At this notebook, i tried to explain gradient descent. Enjoy!
